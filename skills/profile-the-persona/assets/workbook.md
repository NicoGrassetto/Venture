## Output fields

Each data table is an array of row objects. Every analysis row cites evidence IDs.

### persona

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `participant_id` | text |
| `representativeness` | text |
| `goal` | text |
| `workaround` | text |
| `motivation` | text |
| `evidence` | evidence |

### purchasing_criteria

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `rank` | positive_integer |
| `criterion` | text |
| `tradeoff` | text |
| `product_implication` | text |
| `evidence` | evidence |

## Stage rules

- `draft`: unfinished work; validate with `--allow-todo`.
- `research-plan`: leave result tables empty; complete the research protocol and next actions.
- `completed-analysis`: fill every result table with evidence-linked rows and check calculations.

A research-plan row needs question, population, method, metric, threshold, owner, and due_date.
A next-action row needs action, owner, due_date, and evidence_expected.
