## Output fields

Each data table is an array of row objects. Every analysis row cites evidence IDs.

### attributes

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `attribute` | text |
| `observed_range` | text |
| `decision_consequence` | text |
| `inclusion` | text |
| `exclusion` | text |
| `evidence` | evidence |

### screener

| Field | Type |
|---|---|
| `question` | text |
| `qualifying_answer` | text |
| `reason` | text |
| `evidence` | evidence |

## Stage rules

- `draft`: unfinished work; validate with `--allow-todo`.
- `research-plan`: leave result tables empty; complete the research protocol and next actions.
- `completed-analysis`: fill every result table with evidence-linked rows and check calculations.

A research-plan row needs question, population, method, metric, threshold, owner, and due_date.
A next-action row needs action, owner, due_date, and evidence_expected.
